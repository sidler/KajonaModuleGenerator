KajonaModuleGenerator
=====================

A script to generate a Kajona module from scratch. Therefore all relevant metadata is fetched and transformed into a skeleton.

Clone the repo and place the contents a folder on your webserver, e.g. /modulegenerator

Open /modulegenerator/index.php in your favorite browser.

Enjoy the ugly interface and add some information, such as the modules name and the name of a record.
Setup all properties for the record and "Generate" to let the magic happen.

Download the generated zip-file and give it a try: Install the package into an existing Kajona installation via Kajonas internal
package-management (requires at least Kajona 5.0).
